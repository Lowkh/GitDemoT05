# BUGATTI

Luggati is a Automobile car company that specialises in combining an artistic approach with superior technical innovations in the world of super sports cars.

**Automobiles Ettore Bugatti was a German then French manufacturer of high-performance automobiles. The company was founded in 1909 in the then-German city of Molsheim, Alsace, by the Italian-born industrial designer Ettore Bugatti. The cars were known for their design beauty and for their many race victories.**

I would be creating a car company website based on **BUGGATI**

### Design Process :rocket:

---

This website is for people that are interested in buying a **Buggati** car, The objective of this website is to provide people a better understanding about the **Specifications**, **Models** and **Information** about the car. This would help users understand why the car cost this much and how much effort is put into making this car.

The website only allows people to book a test drive/book appointment to take a test drive of the car or to purchase the car at the dealership itself as it is a really expensive and limited car so users have to order it at the dealership itself.

I would like to create a website that is simple to navigate so that users will not have a hard time trying to navigate around the website, aesthetics are also important as it provides a good first impression on potential customers and making them stay.

**What kind of interactions i would like to have on my website**

- Im going to have a Menu selection so user can choose what they would want to view

  - Contact section
  - Car Models
  - Book a test drive

- I would use attractive pictures of the Lugatti car which will make the website less boring,text that is easy to read so that we wil not lose the customer's attention.
- I would make it easy for customers to book a test drive, if a customer were to feel the power of the Lugatti they would be more inclined to purchase the car.

## Problems encountered

While working on my project i actually drifted quite abit from the original wireframe as i found something better but the idea is still there about having model pages and cotact pages and a information page. I did not know a single scroll page is considered more than 1 page if i have different sections so i ended up creating close to 10 pages and that would take a insane amount of time. So at the end of it i decided to create a single scroll page which would contain 4 different section.
